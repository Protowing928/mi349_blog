    <p>Here we recommend having a good graphics computer and your own printer.</p>
    <p>This hobby can be relatively expensive, so remember when it comes to trial and error be patient. It's all part of the learning process, although we'll try to shorten that with tips.</p>
    <p>One of the most important things you should know is your printer's limits and what filiments it can melt. PLA or PLA + is usually the way to go. Fun fact, some colors melt easier than others, like white, but are more suseptable to warping after being printed.</p>
    <p>Great software options for when you have the files to print something are Meshmixer for editing, and Cura for pre-file prep and transfer to know if it will fit on your computer.</p>
    <p>Once all is said and done, make sure your nozzle is as close to the baseplate as possible without rubbing. Once your print is in motion, set your printer to start slowly to increase the success rate of your initial print.</p>
