      <p><img src="Printer.jpg" alt="Printing" width="1500" height="1000"></p>
      <p>3D printing is a fantastic hobby that can get even the most inexperienced people to engage. All you need is a printer and a computer.</p>
      <p>Printers may vary in size and shape, but all of them when used with care and creativity can create fantastic and functional works of art.</p>
      <p>A 3D printer is a machine that uses coordinates based on the XYZ scale to make a model out of stringed filament.</p>
      <p>Give the machine some time to process and before you know it you'll have a unique piece of art.</p>

  <p>Here we have two of my most successful prints I have completed and then painted. The larger one on the left is a 4 piece assembled speaker case.</p>
  <p>The one on the right is a Dead Space Marker from the game printed as a single piece over 1 day.</p>
  <p>The two were printed on the same printer. The speaker case is functional and took 6 days to print.</p>
  <p>Here we offer beginner's guides, tips and maintenence to help you learn the craft and maintain your equipment to get the best results.</p>
