    <p>A Happy Thanksgiving Holiday</p>
<p>I spent a great Thanksgiving holiday with my family--Mom, Dad and our dog, Jack. We ordered dinner from one of our favorite Italian restaurants, Maggiano&#39;s, in Oak Brook, IL.</p>
<p>We started as I said grace and we all shared something for which we were grateful. Our feast included ham, fish, turkey, two pastas (spaghetti and meatballs and ravioli), and multiple side dishes. We ate until we could eat no more, except for the pumpkin cheesecake dessert. We enjoyed red wine and sparkling cider through the evening.</p>
<p>This tradition started during the height of the pandemic, and because I do not like turkey. We ordered a few dishes from Maggiano&#39;s and went to pick it up curbside. We popped the trunk and the restaurant staff loaded our order. When we got home and started bringing the food in, we realized it was not our order but actually The Bundle, with everything from appetizers to dessert. We called the restaurant and they told us to keep it and they would fix the other order. They did us a solid!</p>
<p>We all relaxed on the sofa and watched Netflix the rest of the night. The following day I went to my favorite game shop, Fair Game, and played Magic the Gathering with some old friends I had not seen in three months. </p>
<p>We are still feasting on our leftovers. Heading back to campus and reality tomorrow.</p>
